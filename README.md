A doclet to output javadoc as XML
=================================

This library provides a doclet to output the javadoc comments from Java source code to a XML document.

The name, some ideas and most unit tests were shamelessly stolen from the
[xml-doclet](http://code.google.com/p/xml-doclet) library by Seth Call.
